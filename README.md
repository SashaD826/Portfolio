# Data Analyst Portfolio, Oleksandr Detsyk
## About me
Greetings! 
I am Oleksandr. With a background in organic chemistry, Iâ€™ve used data to achieve precise experimental goals, from analyzing molecular structures to optimizing reaction conditions. This scientific training sharpened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and ability to extract insights from complex datasets. Working with spectroscopic data and metrics like yield and purity deepened my knack for spotting patterns and ensuring accuracy. Transitioning to data analytics, I now channel this analytical mindset into transforming business data into clear, actionable insights.

This portfolio showcases my versatile expertise in data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. It features a collection of diverse projects that highlight my proficiency in uncovering critical business insights through meticulous data processing and strategic analysis. 
Each project reflects my skills in using various tools and instruments to create clear, impactful visualizations and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Technical skills:
- SQL (postgreSQL, MySQL)
- Python (Pandas, matplotlib)
- Power BI (DAX, PowerQuery)
- Excel
- MS PowerPoint, Word

## Portfolio projects
Here, I share a couple of projects where I used various methods to uncover key data insights. Each showcases my enthusiasm for turning data into clear, impactful solutions.

### Bike Sales Breakdown
  **Description:** The dataset contains information about bike store sales over a month.
  
  **Problem:** A certain amount of data cleaning is required. 
  
  **Goal:** To analyse the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, show crucial KPIs, search for potential improvements.
  
  -SQL code: [`Bike Sales SQl`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_mysql.sql)
  
  -Python code: [`Bike Sales Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales.ipynb)
  
  -Excel Worksheet: [`Bike Sales Excel`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_data.xlsx)
  
  -Power BI Dashboard: [`Bike Sales Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Key data to optimize efficiency, including revenue trend over time, a histogram of typical order sizes, and detailed breakdowns by country, region, and product, etc.
 ### IBM Employees Evaluation
  **Description:** Dataset contains information about IBM Employees: their Job Satisfaction, Education Level, Hourly Rate, Experience, etc.

  **Problem:** Complex Dataset, some columns are indexed, and do not contain readable data.

  **Goal:** A comparison of IBM employees' performance, finding trends.

  -SQl code: [`IBM Employees SQL`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_mysql.sql)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IBM Employees Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Crucial data about employees. Trends of their performance depending on age, education, experience.

 ### IT salaries all over the world
  **Description:** This simple yet useful dataset shows salaries for different employment types, positions in numerous countries.

  **Problem:** Dataset is enormous. Values cannot be objectively compared just like that, slicers are needed.

  **Goal:** Get statistical data for multiples positions. Can be used for Machine Learning, for example.

  -Python Code: [`IT Salaries Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries.ipynb)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IT Salaries Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** A Dashboard with multiple slicers that enables to compare jobs depending on employment type, company location, experience level or job itself.
