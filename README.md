# Data Analyst Portfolio, Oleksandr Detsyk
## About me
Greetings! 
I am Oleksandr. With a background in organic chemistry, Iâ€™ve used data to achieve precise experimental goals, from analyzing molecular structures to optimizing reaction conditions. This scientific training sharpened my analytical thinking, problem-solving, and ability to extract insights from complex datasets. Working with spectroscopic data and metrics like yield and purity deepened my knack for spotting patterns and ensuring accuracy. Transitioning to data analytics, I now channel this analytical mindset into transforming business data into clear, actionable insights.

This portfolio showcases my versatile expertise in data cleaning, data analysis, and data visualization, demonstrating my ability to transform raw data into meaningful, actionable insights. It features a collection of diverse projects that highlight my proficiency in uncovering critical business insights through meticulous data processing and strategic analysis. 
Each project reflects my skills in using various tools and instruments to create clear, impactful visualizations and track key performance indicators (KPIs).

## Technical skills
- SQL (postgreSQL, MySQL)
- Python (Pandas, matplotlib)
- Power BI (DAX, PowerQuery)
- Excel
- MS PowerPoint, Word

## Portfolio projects
Here, I share a couple of projects where I used various methods to uncover key data insights. Each showcases my enthusiasm for turning data into clear, impactful solutions.

### Bike Sales Breakdown
  **Description:** The dataset captures detailed sales data from a bike store over a one-month period, encompassing key metrics such as product descriptions, revenue, profits, production cost, customer details and transaction dates.
  
  **Problem:** The dataset requires targeted data cleaning to ensure accuracy and usability, including handling missing values, standardizing product descriptions, and correcting inconsistencies in transaction dates or sales figures. 
  
  **Goal:** To analyse the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, show crucial KPIs, search for potential improvements.

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`Bike Sales Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Key data to optimize efficiency, including revenue trend over time, a histogram of typical order sizes, and detailed breakdowns by week day, country, region, and product.
 ### IBM Employees Evaluation
  **Description:** Dataset contains information about IBM Employees: their Job Satisfaction, Education Level, Hourly Rate, Experience, etc.

  **Problem:** Complex Dataset, some columns are indexed, instead of containing readable data.

  **Goal:** Analyse IBM employees' performance, identify key trends to optimize workforce productivity.

  -SQl code: [`IBM Employees SQL`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_mysql.sql)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IBM Employees Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Crucial data about employees. Trends of their performance depending on age, education, experience.

 ### IT salaries all over the world
  **Description:** This simple yet useful dataset shows salaries for different employment types and positions in numerous countries.

  **Problem:** The dataset is vast, requiring careful handling as values cannot be directly compared without segmentation. Implementing slicers enables precise filtering and meaningful comparisons, ensuring accurate insights from the complex data.

  **Goal:** Get statistical data for multiples positions. Can be used for Machine Learning, for example.

  -Python Code: [`IT Salaries Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries.ipynb)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IT Salaries Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** A Dashboard with key statistical indicators and multiple slicers that enables to compare jobs depending on employment type, company location, experience level or job title itself.

   ### Alphabet Stock evaluation
  **Description:** Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive analysis of GOOG stock's daily investment attractiveness over 20+ years, incorporating essential indicators and dynamic visualizations.

  **Problem:** P/E ratios had to be data scrapped and added manually

  **Goal:** To create the graph with daily GOOG stock price, and combine it with 50-day moving average and a P/E ratio.

  -SQL Code: [`GOOG stock SQL`]

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`GOOG stock Power BI`]

  **Results:** The Power BI dashboard leverages fundamental and technical indicators to empower informed investment decisions for GOOG stock.
