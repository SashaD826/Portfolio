## Portfolio projects
Here, I share a couple of projects where I used various methods to uncover key data insights. Each showcases my enthusiasm for turning data into clear, impactful solutions.

### Book Recommender
  **Description:** The Book Recommender is a Python-based application that suggests books based on a user's favorite book, using a relatively large database of books and their ratings. It analyzes book attributes like title, author and returns a list of recommended books that were chosen according to their correlation with the user's favorite book. The system handles errors for invalid inputs, incomplete book titles and typos.
   
   **Problem:** The dataset is relatively large, the same book can have variations in its book titles.

   **Goal:** A user-friendly Python application that delivers personalized book recommendations based on a user's favorite book. The highly tunable system features robust error handling for invalid inputs.

   - Python code: [`Book Recommender`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/book_recommender2.ipynb)
   
   **Results:** A user-friendly application that recommends books to a users according to his preferences.

### Bike Sales Breakdown
  **Description:** The dataset captures detailed sales data from a bike store over a one-month period, encompassing key metrics such as product descriptions, revenue, profits, production cost, customer details and transaction dates.
  
  **Problem:** The dataset requires targeted data cleaning to ensure accuracy and usability, including handling missing values, standardizing product descriptions, and correcting inconsistencies in transaction dates or sales figures. 
  
  **Goal:** To analyse the sales history of the store and extract insights on its performance, show crucial KPIs, search for potential improvements.

  -Python code: [`Bike Sales Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales.ipynb)
  
  -Excel Worksheet: [`Bike Sales Excel`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_data.xlsx)
  
  -Power BI Dashboard: [`Bike Sales Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/bike_sales_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Key data to optimize efficiency, including revenue trend over time, a histogram of typical order sizes, and detailed breakdowns by week day, country, region, and product.

 ### IBM Employees Evaluation
  **Description:** Dataset contains information about IBM Employees: their Job Satisfaction, Education Level, Hourly Rate, Experience, etc.

  **Problem:** Complex Dataset, some columns are indexed, instead of containing readable data.

  **Goal:** To analyse IBM employees' performance, identify key trends to optimize workforce productivity.

  -SQl code: [`IBM Employees SQL`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_mysql.sql)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IBM Employees Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/ibm_employees_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** Crucial data about employees. Trends of their performance depending on age, education, experience.

 ### IT salaries all over the world
  **Description:** This simple yet useful dataset shows salaries for different employment types and positions in numerous countries.

  **Problem:** The dataset is vast, requiring careful handling as values cannot be directly compared without segmentation. Implementing slicers enables precise filtering and meaningful comparisons, ensuring accurate insights from the complex data.

  **Goal:** To get statistical data for multiples positions. Can be used for Machine Learning, for example.

  -Python Code: [`IT Salaries Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries.ipynb)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`IT Salaries Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/it_salaries_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** A Dashboard with key statistical indicators and multiple slicers that enables to compare jobs depending on employment type, company location, experience level or job title itself.

   ### Automated Portfolio Rebalancing
   **Description:** This simple, but useful Python code helps with rebalancing the portfolio: calculates number of shares that has to be purchased, and the amount that has to be spent per position.

   **Problem:** For the purpose of tax optimization, no shares can be sold, only buying is allowed.

   **Goal:** To automate the process to make it more effective. Just import the file, set the composition thresholds and code will do all the work.

  -Python code: [`Portfolio Rebalancing Python`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/portfolio_rebalancing.ipynb)

  **Results:** Goal achieved, but to make the code even better API should be used to fully automate the process.

  **Data Source:** [Portfolio Composition CSV](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/etf_portfolio_rebalancing.csv)
   ### Alphabet Stock Evaluation
  **Description:** Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive, interactive analysis of GOOG stock's daily investment attractiveness over 20+ years, incorporating essential indicators and dynamic visualizations.

  **Problem:** P/E ratios had to be data scrapped and added manually

  **Goal:** To create the graph with daily GOOG stock price, and combine it with 50-day moving average and a P/E ratio.

  -SQL Code: [`GOOG stock SQL`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/goog_stock_postgres.sql)

  -Power BI Dashboard: [`GOOG stock Power BI`](https://github.com/SashaD826/Portfolio/blob/main/goog_stock_bi.pbix)

  **Results:** The Power BI dashboard leverages fundamental and technical indicators to empower informed investment decisions for GOOG stock.
